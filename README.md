# 🧪 Rails E2E Testing Framework Showcase

A comprehensive demonstration of **5 different testing frameworks** working together in a Rails 7 application. This project showcases how to implement and compare MiniTest, RSpec, Capybara, Cucumber, and Playwright for end-to-end testing.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

**Complete E2E Testing Coverage:**
- **MiniTest** - Rails built-in testing (fast, simple)
- **RSpec** - Behavior-driven development with readable syntax
- **Capybara** - User interaction simulation (works with both MiniTest & RSpec)
- **Cucumber** - Human-readable acceptance tests using Gherkin syntax
- **Playwright** - Modern cross-browser E2E testing with TypeScript

**Sample Application:**
- Simple blog with Posts (title, content, published status)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Form validations and error handling
- Published vs Draft post filtering

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Ruby 3.1+**
- **Rails 7+**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Node.js 18+** (for Playwright)
- **Bun** (faster alternative to npm)

### Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# 2. Setup database
make db-setup

# 3. Generate sample blog
make generate-blog

# 4. Setup all testing frameworks

## 📝 Test Examples

### MiniTest Style
```ruby
test "creating a new post" do
  visit posts_path
  click_on "New post"
  fill_in "Title", with: "MiniTest Post"
  click_on "Create Post"
  assert_text "Post was successfully created"
end
```

### RSpec Style
```ruby
it 'allows user to create a published post' do
  visit posts_path
  fill_in 'Title', with: 'RSpec Post'
  click_button 'Create Post'
  expect(page).to have_content('Post was successfully created')
end
```

### Cucumber Style
```gherkin
Scenario: Creating a new published post
  Given I am on the posts page
  When I click "New post"
  And I fill in "Title" with "Cucumber Post"
  Then I should see "Post was successfully created"
```

### Playwright Style (TypeScript)
```typescript
test('should create a new published post', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/posts/new');
  await page.fill('input[name="post[title]"]', 'Playwright Post');
  await page.click('input[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page.locator('text=Post was successfully created')).toBeVisible();
});

```bash
# View all reports
make reports

# Individual reports
make report-rspec      # RSpec HTML report
make report-cucumber   # Cucumber HTML report
make report-playwright # Playwright HTML report
```

**Report Locations:**

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
brew services start postgresql

# Create databases
make db-setup
```

**Port 3000 Already in Use:**
```bash
# Kill existing Rails server
make kill-server

# Check what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000
```

**Playwright Browser Issues:**
```bash
# Reinstall browsers
make setup-playwright

# Debug browser installation
cd playwright-tests && bun run install-browsers
```

**Gem Installation Issues:**
